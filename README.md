https://vanityhikes.com is a dataviz side project aimed at displaying my hikes on open street maps.

A few years back I developed a passion for hiking and spending time in the wild.

As a data engineer, I love manipulating data and after hiking a few thousand kilometers, it came to
me that I could use those gpx traces I record with my Garmin watch and compute stats out of them.
For instance the total distance I've walked, the most positive elevation I've hiked in 1 hour, ...
I love stats! So I've built a script to do so, using Scala, my favourite (and professional) language.

And I also love playing around with d3.js to build dataviz (as part of my job or on side projects).
So at some point, after having built those stats around my gpx traces, I've started toying with displaying
those hikes on open street maps using d3.js. As it worked pretty well, I ended up adding quite a few
other features on that website, such as providing access to photos I take outdoor, making it something
probably worth putting out there, at https://vanityhikes.com.
